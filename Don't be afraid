1. Introduction: Beginnings and Ideas

For centuries, extorters have preyed on people's fears, threatening them with violence or harm, often using the threat of death to control them. However, in this article, 
I want to focus on extortion, sextortion, and other forms of online exploitation. I’ve founded a platform and community specifically designed to counter extortion and ensure 
that these criminals don’t get away with their actions.

Before I became an advocate for counter-extortion, I was just an observer, minding my business on various gaming platforms. 
I had some interest in cybersecurity but wasn’t deeply involved—until I began participating in online communities in August 2024.

2. Starting, Networks, and Connections

I joined a group called Zone, which was struggling at the time—though I now own it, more on that later. 
Zone, despite not being specifically focused on counter-extortion, was well-known in certain circles. As a result, Zone found itself consistently on the edge of the extortion world, 
with connections to groups like 764, Kaskar, NLM, SlitTown, and Death Valley.

My first real interaction with these groups came through Zone, where I met someone using the alias Federalzone/Omni. He had friends who were former extorters, 
such as Buckshot and Tears, with whom I still maintain contact to this day. These people are decently respected in the community to this day especially extort communities,
and they still talk to everyone from there.

3. Adventures, Leadership, Manifesto, and Ideals

This experience intrigued me, especially considering the chaotic, almost schizophrenic nature of these groups and the way they expressed their ideals. 
I wasn’t welcomed in extortion communities at first, but I soon realized that respect in these groups was often gained through disturbing actions, like harming animals or indulging in sick rituals.

Around December 2024, my friends invited me to create social platforms centered on the extortion aesthetic. 
I was given control of a group called Kaskar by Buckshot—perhaps as a joke, perhaps not—but I found myself fascinated by how these communities operated. 
While I never engaged in extortion or associated with people I found morally repugnant, I quickly recognized the danger posed by these groups. 
Seeing people extorted into doing terrible things, like abusing animals or engaging in self-harm, made me realize that these individuals were not only a danger to themselves but also to others.

4. Warfare Against the Ideal and Foundations

At that time, I made a crucial decision: I couldn’t simply walk away from these people, as doing so would weaken my influence and connections. 
I founded a group called Crimson, aiming to gain control over groups like 764 and Kaskar. People like Ven NLM and Banks joined at the time, and others formed their own variants of Kaskar, fueled by internet fame. 
Despite the growing opposition, I remained focused on my goal.

I spent my time studying the ideals and aesthetics of these extortionists, including their fascination with controversial ideologies like National Socialism and Satanism. 
These groups are made up of individuals, often edgy teenagers, looking for attention they can’t get in real life. Their actions, while once feared, no longer hold the same power they once did.

At the same time, I worked with Anti-Extorters to infiltrate and undermine these groups. The people being extorted are often innocent and unaware of the tactics being used against them. 
It became clear that these people needed help, and that I had the tools to offer it - knowledge. I owned or was known to some people to own all the groups you hear and fear about, they're not scary.

What I can say about them is that they are: weak-minded, uneducated and striving for attention and they eventually stop even being stubborn if you do not give them what they seek.

5. Deep Dive onto Extortion Com

As I mentioned before, I owned several of these groups, which also gave me access to the leadership of other extortion communities like 764 (owned by Trippy764), 
Kaskar (owned by Banks), NLM (led by Ven), and several other prominent groups that were active at the time. One thing I noticed about all these groups was their 
tendency to greatly exaggerate their activities and "lore" in an attempt to make themselves seem more intimidating to new victims—victims who, aside from media reports and 
poorly conducted OSINT investigations, knew very little about these groups or their supposed reach.

I had many conversations with members of these groups to understand what they actually believed in, and I was met with a wide variety of answers. For example, Trippy764, the leader of 764, was fascinated by National Socialism. 
However, his knowledge on the subject was lacking, and he actually sought me out to explain Hitler's ideas to him, asking how he could implement these into his own groups. Banks, who later aligned with Trippy764, 
seemed to have been influenced by him, and the two of them began using swastikas more prominently as time went on.

Despite their enthusiasm, it became clear that their understanding of what they were advocating for was shallow at best. 
They gave up on trying to educate themselves and instead opted to embrace chaotic violence as their new "identity."

However, there was one surprising exception: Trippy764 himself. He was the only one in the group who expressed a genuine desire to change. 
He promised me that he would stop extorting kids and instead focus on graffiti and arson—activities more aligned with their love for creating content for their misguided groups. 
Ironically, Trippy seemed to genuinely want to improve and move away from the more damaging aspects of extortion.

I haven’t spoken to him much since then, but it’s clear that Trippy was likely lying about his intentions. Nevertheless, his brief attempt at self-improvement sheds light on the state of the extortion world as a whole. 
It is filled with misinformed, powerless individuals trying to project fake power and intimidation against vulnerable targets—those who lack the ability to defend themselves and often have poor operational security.

7. Operational Security

To help protect yourself from becoming a victim of these predators, I want to give you a simple guide on Operational Security (OpSec). By following these steps, you can safeguard your identity and online presence:
Always use temporary or fake emails when interacting with anyone from these groups. Alternatively, you can create an email through a service like Cloudflare to obscure your real identity. 
Remember, your real name or personal details should never be tied to these communications. Make sure everything connected to your online activity is falsified or anonymous. 
This includes your username, IP address, location, and any other identifying information.

Always use a reliable VPN, such as Mullvad VPN, to ensure that your online activity is protected and masked. This prevents your real location or IP address from being exposed.
Do not engage with these groups or any individuals associated with them. Interacting with them can expose you to unnecessary risk. It's important to understand that these individuals hold no true power over you unless you give them access to your personal information.

By taking these simple steps, you can significantly reduce your chances of becoming a target. Always remember, these weird pedophiles and extorters thrive on fear and vulnerability—they hold no real control over you unless you let them.

8. Manifesto

A person I know, Bear, who founded Anti-Extortion com, put things into perspective with one powerful idea that I am now adopting:

"If you give these people attention, they will thrive off of it—and continue to do so."

While I agree with this to some extent, I also believe that the world cannot rely solely on hope to stop these people. You, the reader, can make a difference. Your contributions, no matter how small, matter.
These extorters will not go away as long as their fame persists. But you can stand up for yourself, for your family, for your friends, and for anyone you care about. I’m here to tell you that these people, 
while they may seem intimidating, are ultimately powerless and harmless. The most they can do is harass you or your loved ones—but your allies, like the police and your family, will be there to support you.

The clips and threats you see online? They’re likely fake, or years old. The so-called “cutsigns” they use to intimidate you? 
Those are the actions of people who could easily be you if you don’t stand up for yourself. The stories they tell? They’re lies, carefully crafted to manipulate and control you.

Remember this: "Great liars are also great magicians." – Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf

7. Bottom Line

I’m here as your ally. If you need help, don’t hesitate to reach out to me, Anti-Extorters, or any other counter-extortion groups. 
We will guide you through this and explain how these groups operate, and why they’re not as dangerous as they appear.

Don’t be afraid. We are with you, even in the dark.
